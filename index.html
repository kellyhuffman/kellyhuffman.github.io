            <p>I am a wife, mother of four, 
                full time Project Manager for an Industrial Coating Company, 
                and owner of two Women's Sober Living facilites in Baton Rouge, La., 
                who on her spare time aspires to be a Film Producer.When I am not chasing kids around or working like crazy, I love building
                up women who are broken and trying to escape a world of addiction and 
                I am working on finishing up school so I can eventually work as a film producer.
                My concentration at school has been working towards my associastes 
                degree in Applied Science of Entertainment Technology with my main focus 
                on Film. I have this vision to make documentaries and encouraging movies that bring hope 
                to broken people. On my spare time I love to shop, hang out with my kids,
                go fishing, play with makeup, and make collages.
